	Example
	occurs_check (v, t) where v is of type Variable, t is of type Term.
	occurs_check (v, t) returns true if the Prolog Variable v occurs in t.
	Please see the lecture note Control in Prolog to revisit the concept of
	occurs-check.

	Problem 1
	variables_of_term (t) where t is of type Term.
	variables_of_clause (c) where c is of type Rule.

	The function should return the Variables contained in a term or a rule
	using Python set.

	The result must be saved in a Python set. The type of each element (a Prolog Variable)
	in the set is Variable.

	Problem 2
	substitute_in_term (s, t) where s is of type dictionary and t is of type Term
	substitute_in_clause (s, t) where s is of type dictionary and c is of type Rule,

	The value of type dict should be a Python dictionary whose keys are of type Variable
	and values are of type Term. It is a map from variables to terms.

	The function should return t_ obtained by applying substitution s to t.

	Please use Python dictionary to represent a subsititution map.

	Problem 3
	unify (t1, t2) where t1 is of type term and t2 is of type Term.
	The function should return a substitution map of type dict,
	which is a unifier of the given terms. You may find the pseudocode
	of unify in the lecture note Control in Prolog useful.

	The function should raise the exception raise Not_unfifiable (),
	if the given terms are not unifiable.

	Please use Python dictionary to represent a subsititution map.

	Problem 4
	Following the Abstract interpreter pseudocode in the lecture note Control in Prolog to implement
	a nondeterministic Prolog interpreter.

	nondet_query (program, goal) where
		the first argument is a program which is a list of Rules.
		the second argument is a goal which is a list of Terms.

	The function returns a list of Terms (results), which is an instance of the original goal and is
	a logical consequence of the program. See the tests cases (in src/main.py) as examples.
	'''

	'''
	Challenge Problem

	det_query (program, goal) where
		the first argument is a program which is a list of Rules.
		the second argument is a goal which is a list of Terms.

	The function returns a list of term lists (results). Each of these results is
	an instance of the original goal and is a logical consequence of the program.
	If the given goal is not a logical consequence of the program, then the result
	is an empty list. See the test cases (in src/main.py) as examples.
